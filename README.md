   Here is a simple way to install brownie.
   ```
    pip install --user pipx
    pipx ensurepath
    # restart your terminal
    pipx install eth-brownie
   ```
   Or if you can't get pipx to work, via pip (it's recommended to use pipx)
    ```
    pip install eth-brownie
    ```
   
3. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Aymen1001/uniswap-sushiswap-arbitrage.git
   cd uniswap-sushiswap-arbitrage
   ```
